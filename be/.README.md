# Rocket API Documentation

This API provides information about rockets and their components. Below are the available endpoints and their usages:

## Get Rocket Hierarchy

- **Endpoint**: `@app.get("/rocket/{rocket_id}")`
- **Example**: `@app.get("/rocket/1")`
- **Description**: This endpoint retrieves the entire hierarchy of a rocket specified by its ID.

## Get Specific Rocket Component Hierarchy

- **Endpoint**: `@app.get("/rocket/{rocket_id}/{children:path}")`
- **Description**: This endpoint allows you to access specific components within a rocket hierarchy by specifying the path to the component you want.

### Example Usages:

#### Get Stage1 Hierarchy of Rocket 1

- **Endpoint**: `@app.get("/rocket/1/Stage1")`
- **Description**: This endpoint retrieves the hierarchy of Stage1 components for Rocket 1.
-**note**: Stage1, Engin1, Thrust to access they all are case sensitive

#### Get Engine2 Hierarchy within Stage1 of Rocket 1

- **Endpoint**: `@app.get("/rocket/1/Stage1/Engine2")`
- **Description**: This endpoint retrieves the hierarchy of Engine2 within Stage1 for Rocket 1.
# Rocket API Documentation

This API provides information about rockets and their components. Below are the available endpoints and their usages:

## Get Rocket Hierarchy

- **Endpoint**: `@app.get("/rocket/{rocket_id}")`
- **Example**: `@app.get("/rocket/1")`
- **Description**: This endpoint retrieves the entire hierarchy of a rocket specified by its ID.


## Post Endpoints

To create or modify specific components within the rocket hierarchy, you can use the following POST endpoint:

This endpoint allows for a variety of variations according to the provided example, such as "/Rocket/Stage2/RocketJr."

Create a Rocket Component
To create a new component, for example, a "RocketJr" node in the "Stage2" hierarchy, you can use the following request:

```http
POST /rocket/{rocket_id}/{children:path}

####Create a Rocket Component
To create a new component, for example, a "RocketJr" node in the "Stage2" hierarchy, you can use the following request:

```http
POST /rocket/{id}/Stage2/RocketJr

With Empy Json Body - { }

This will successfully create a "RocketJr" node within the "Stage2" hierarchy of the specified rocket.

### Modify a Rocket Component
To modify a component within the hierarchy, you can use the POST request with a JSON body containing the desired modifications. 

For example, to update the "RocketJr" node in "Stage2" with speed information, use the following request:

```http
POST /rocket/{id}/Stage2/RocketJr

wiht Json body :- 
{
  "speed": {
    "lightspeed": 0.24,
    "soundspeed": 1.2
  }
}

This endpoint will successfully store the provided body as required for your Rocket application.

Please ensure that you use the appropriate HTTP client or tool to make these POST requests, providing the correct endpoint and JSON payload as needed.





## Handling Exceptions

Exceptions have been handled as per the requirements of the API to ensure robust and reliable operation.

Please note that you should replace `@app.get` with the appropriate method and route handling code based on your web framework or library (e.g., FastAPI, Flask). Make sure to provide any necessary authentication and request parameters as required by your API.

For more detailed information on the API usage, refer to the code and documentation within the project.
